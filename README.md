After switching on the website, please follow the path.

After completing the task, I realized that the code could have been better built.
I noticed, that many repetitive items got different classes that are described separately in css.
This could be anticipated in the beginning and guided the design so that the repeating elements had the same classes defined once.

This website is really simple, but very instructive to me.
